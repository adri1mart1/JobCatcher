# JobCatcher

![JobCatcher Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/yoannsculo/JobCatcher/master/screenshots/jobcatcher.png)

JobCatcher is a daemon that retrieves job offers from multiple job boards feeds
and generates custom RSS feeds and HTML reports for you. This is a decentralized
software meant to run of your own server.

JobCatcher comes with a filter feature, so you can filter company names with
black or whitelists.

Think of it as a RSS feed reader with filter feature.

I would like this software to be under GPLv2 License. But I need to check if
this is compatible with dependencies I've choosen.

## Work in Progress

The project is fully in development and many features need to be implemented.
It is developed in Python. This is my first time I use Python on a non-basic
project. So I guess my code is not so pythonic ... yet. Feel free to help me or
show me mistakes I could have made or improvements I could do.

## Dependencies

	python-html2text, python-requests, python-beautifulsoup

## Usage (mainly development options for now)

    --all              sync the blacklist, fetch the offers and generates reports.
    --feeds            download the all feeds in the config
    --feed=JOBBOARD    download only the feed from JOBBOARD in the config
    --pages            download the all pages in the config
    --page=JOBBOARD    download only the pages from JOBBOARD in the config
    --inserts          inserts all pages to offers
    --insert=JOBBOARD  insert JOBBOARD pages to offers
    --moves            move datas to offer
    --move=JOBBOARD    move JOBBOARD datas to offer
    --clean=JOBBOARD   clean offers from JOBBOARD source
    --report           generate a full report
    --version          output version information and exit

Reports are generated into the local "www" directory.

I start jobcatcher.py -s manually with crontab for now. But this should change
soon.
